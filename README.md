### Underwater acoustic target recognition -- Convolution-based Mixture of Experts


This is the PyTorch implementation of the paper:   
**"Unraveling Complex Data Diversity in Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition through Convolution-based Mixture of Experts"**,      
which has been published on **Expert Systems with Applications**.     

**DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2024.123431**      
**Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11919**

In addition to the model architecture (cmoe_model.py), this repository provides pre-extracted features of the Shipsear test set, along with corresponding testing code.     
I can ensure that the optimal model mentioned in the paper, which has an 86.21% 9-class accuracy, is entirely reproducible.
